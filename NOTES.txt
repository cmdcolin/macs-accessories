The type column contains S for SNPs, I for insertions,
D for deletions, and M for probe sets which interrogated
more than one polymorphism (i.e., consecutive SNPs, or a SNP
near an insertion or deletion).

MUMer alignment

nucmer is the MUMmer's most user-friendly alignment script for standard DNA sequence alignment. It is a robust pipeline that allows for multiple reference and multiple query sequences to be aligned in a many vs. many fashion. For instance, a very common use for nucmer is to determine the position and orientation of a set of sequence contigs in relation to a finished sequence, however it can be just as effective in comparing two finished sequences to one another.
$ nucmer -maxmatch -c 100 -p nucmer S288c-genome-v3.fa YJM789.fsa
$ mummerplot -postscript -p nucmer nucmer.delta
$ ps2pdf nucmer.ps
