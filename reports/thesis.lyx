\begin_layout Title
Comparison of transcription factor binding sites from ChIP-seq experiments
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Transcription factors play an important role in gene regulation by binding
 and interacting with DNA.
 Identifying the DNA-binding activity for transcription factors and other
 proteins has become an important problem for understanding gene regulation.
 Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq) combined with high-throughput
 sequencing has been used to analyze DNA-protein interactions such as transcript
ion factor binding.
 Unfortunately, the metrics for identifying transcription factor binding
 sites are not directly comparable across experiments, which makes it difficult
 to assess the significance of the conserved and differential binding sites.
 We created a software framework for processing ChIP-seq data and used a
 statistical hypothesis testing approach to directly compare the read count
 data from different ChIP-seq experiments to find differential binding sites.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The study of eukaryotic genomes has revealed a complex world of proteins
 that bind to DNA to regulate gene expression.
 Transcription factors are one type of DNA-binding protein that is important
 for regulating genes.
 Most transcription factors tend to bind to specific DNA sequences, and
 influence the expression of nearby genes.
 Finding these binding sites and profiling the activity of transcription
 factor binding under different conditions has become important for understandin
g gene regulation, however, studies have shown that these binding sites
 can vary significantly 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "zheng_genetic_2010,odom_tissue-specific_2007"

\end_inset

.
 Studying the DNA-binding activity of transcription factors can reveal clues
 about how the genome regulatory system works.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Chromatin immunoprecipitation is an experimental methodology to profile
 the DNA-binding sites for DNA-binding proteins.
 Essentially, chromatin immunoprecipitation uses specific antibodies to
 isolate a particular protein and the DNA it is attached to.
 The DNA fragments can then be analyzed using a variety of techniques.
 One such method uses chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with high throughpu
t sequencing (ChIP-seq) to sequence the DNA fragments produced from chromatin
 immunoprecipitation.
 ChIP-seq produces millions of short DNA sequence reads that are enriched
 for particular DNA-binding sites.
 After aligning the short reads to a reference genome, this method can provide
 a whole-genome view of a particular transcription factor’s binding sites.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
New computational techniques have been developed to address problems of
 analyzing high-throughput data.
 In the area of ChIP-seq in particular, there have been many algorithms
 for finding transcription factor binding sites, but many of these algorithms
 are only used to analyze individual experiments, and are not used to compare
 experiments 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "wilbanks_evaluation_2010"

\end_inset

.
 While it is important to be able to identify features from individual high-thro
ughput experiments, it has not been clear how the metrics that characterize
 the binding sites from peak finders can be compared across different experiment
s.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to compare results from different ChIP-seq experiments, normalization
 can be used to account for different experimental variables.
 Different types of normalizations have been developed to account for variables
 in ChIP-seq, and one common method for normalizing high-throughput sequencing
 data is scaling for read depth 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "zhang_model-based_2008,zheng_genetic_2010"

\end_inset

.
 Other methods for normalizing have been developed to estimate the background
 noise to improve scaling factors 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "diaz_normalization_2012,liang_normalization_2012"

\end_inset

, to use a linear model to scale read depth 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "shao_manorm:_2012"

\end_inset

, and to estimate changes in the variance of the data across the genome
 to reduce bias 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "zheng_genetic_2010,zhang_model-based_2008,kuan_statistical_2011"

\end_inset

.
 These normalization methods are helpful for comparing the results from
 different ChIP-seq experiments, and also just for comparing a ChIP-seq
 against a control.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another consideration for comparing experiments is the appropriate use of
 statistical testing.
 A variety of statistical models have been developed for finding binding
 sites from individual experiments (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "wilbanks_evaluation_2010"

\end_inset

 for review), but there are also some methods that focus on comparing ChIP-seq
 experiments.
 The methods that have been used for comparing ChIP-seq experiments include
 a Bayesian Poisson model to find conserved binding sites 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "shao_manorm:_2012"

\end_inset

, negative binomial models to model variance across experiments 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "robinson_edger:_2010,ji_integrated_2008,kuan_statistical_2011"

\end_inset

, estimating mixture-model for evaluating differential binding sites 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "taslim_comparative_2009"

\end_inset

, using the variance of the read scores across experiments to find variable
 binding regions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "zheng_genetic_2010"

\end_inset

, and by directly comparing experiments using a dynamic Poisson 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "zhang_model-based_2008"

\end_inset

.
 Each of these methods have unique approaches that address different concerns,
 however each is suited to particular applications but some of these methods
 are not fit for comparing different ChIP-seq experiments and some are not
 able to incorporate replicate experiments into their analysis.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We created software for comparing ChIP-seq experiments using a hypothesis
 testing approach to reveal differential binding sites among yeast strains.
 We adopted a statistical framework that uses a “moderated t-test”, which
 was developed for comparing gene expression data for microarrays, to compare
 ChIP-seq data 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "smyth_linear_2004"

\end_inset

.
 This framework has a number of advantages, including the ability to incorporate
 replicates.
 We use the moderated t-test to find significant differential binding sites
 from ChIP-seq experiments.
 The approach fits into a framework that offers flexible options for data
 analysis and experimental design.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Chromatin immunoprecipitation, ChIP-chip, and ChIP-seq
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is an experimental methodology that
 can be used to find the binding sites of DNA-binding proteins.
 ChIP uses a special antibody to target a protein of interest, and then
 the protein and the DNA to which it is bound are precipitated from the
 mixture.
 Then, the proteins are unlinked from the DNA, resulting in a DNA library
 that is enriched for the binding sites of that particular protein.
 Many different variations of the ChIP protocol have been developed 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "collas_chromatin_2009"

\end_inset

 but the main outline of the protocol is shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:The-ChIP-seq-workflow"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to interpret the DNA fragments from a ChIP experiment, additional
 steps can be applied.
 Classical methods for analyzing DNA fragments have used PCR (polymerase
 chain reaction) and electrophoresis gel, but newer “high-throughput” techniques
 are now popular which can analyze many different fragments of DNA simultaneousl
y.
 Different types of high throughput technologies have been developed which,
 when used with ChIP, can provide a large scale or whole-genome view of
 DNA-protein interactions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "collas_chromatin_2009"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
DNA microarrays are one type of high-throughput technology which can analyze
 the DNA fragments from a ChIP experiment (ChIP-chip).
 ChIP-chip applications use microarrays have been developed for yeast that
 cover the whole genome, but for other genomes such as mouse and human,
 the microarrays are printed with oligonucleotides from upstream regions
 of the target genes in order to detect the transcription factors that are
 the most likely regulators 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "odom_tissue-specific_2007"

\end_inset

.
 Using so-called tiled arrays or high-density microarrays increases the
 resolution that binding sites can be detected.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
AAnother method known as ChIP-seq uses high-throughput sequencing to analyze
 the DNA fragments of a ChIP experiment.
 High-throughput sequencing creates millions of short DNA reads (20-50bp)
 which are produced from sequencing the 3’ end of the DNA fragments.
 A general overview of the ChIP-seq workflow is shown in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:The-ChIP-seq-workflow"

\end_inset

.
 Essentially, the ChIP-seq protocol uses high-throughput sequencing of the
 ChIP DNA fragments and uses DNA alignment algorithms to map the short reads
 to the genome.
 This produces millions of short reads that are enriched for the DNA associated
 with a particular DNA-binding protein and can be used to find the binding
 sites.
 The data is also fairly noisy because ChIP is an enrichment protocol.
 To estimate the significance of the peaks, control data can be generated
 by sequencing the DNA without any anti-body targets, which is called input
 control DNA.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many problems for analyzing this data and for finding transcription
 factor binding sites.
 The main idea is that many of the short read sequences repetitively cover
 a particular region of the DNA forming peaks where there are binding sites.
 These peak finding algorithms are common for detecting transcription factor
 binding sites from ChIP-seq data and we discuss them in the next section.

\begin_layout Subsection
Finding transcription factor binding sites
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To find transcription factor binding sites, peak finding algorithms are
 commonly used to find regions of the genome where ChIP-seq read counts
 exceed a certain threshold.
 The statistical problem of peak finding is a classic one: peak finders
 must be discriminative enough to avoid false positives, but they must also
 be sensitive enough to avoid false negatives.
 We looked at a popular and open-source software package for peak finding
 called MACS (Model-based analysis of ChIP-seq) to see how potential binding
 sites are identified from ChIP-seq data 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "zhang_model-based_2008"

\end_inset

.
 A brief overview of peak finding algorithm that MACS uses is as follows:
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first step MACS uses is to build a peak model to estimate the original
 size of the DNA fragments.
 This step is important for peak calling because, conceivably, the transcription
 factor can bind to any location on the DNA fragment, and so using only
 the short reads to find binding sites might misrepresent their true location.
 To estimate the size of the original DNA fragments, a peak model is used
 to estimate the distance between the bi-modal distribution of sense and
 anti-sense reads (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:Fragment-size-estimation"

\end_inset

).
 Small peaks are found from the sense and anti-sense reads using a naïve
 peak finder based on fold-changes, and then the median distance between
 pairs of peaks is used to represent the DNA fragment length.

\begin_layout Standard
After building a peak model, MACS uses a “dynamic” Poisson rate parameter
 to estimate the background distribution of reads for the whole-genome as
 well as for local regions.
 The estimation of variance using the Poisson background from local regions
 can help reduce the bias that has been observed in the promoter regions
 or from other sources of bias
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "kuan_statistical_2011,nix_empirical_2008"

\end_inset

.
 If control data exists, then the Poisson parameters are estimated from
 the control data, otherwise, the ChIP-seq data itself to estimate the backgroun
d.
 Since the number of reads might be different between ChIP-seq and control,
 the lambda parameter is scaled by the ratio between the total number of
 reads in the ChIP-seq/total number of reads in the control.
 The size of the scanning window is equal to 2*d, where d is the estimated
 DNA fragment size.
 (default value d=100bp).
 If a given scanning window exceeds a certain likelihood, then it is merged
 with nearby windows that also exceed the threshold and they are called
 a peak.
 The resulting output from MACS is a list of high confidence ChIP-seq peaks
 that represent potential transcription factor binding sites.

\begin_layout Standard
Identifying peaks is important for finding potential transcription factor
 binding sites, but it can be difficult to compare these results between
 experiments.
 For instance, the number of reads in a peak region can depend on non-biological
 variables such as the ChIP-seq enrichment and the library size.
 Other metrics such as the false discovery rate (FDR) and p-value also represent
 confidence in the peaks, but this is explicitly related to the confidence
 compared with the background, which makes comparisons of data difficult.
 Performing a more direct comparison of the ChIP-seq data by including normaliza
tion and statistical comparisons can give a better assessment of how transcripti
on factor binding sites vary across experiments.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Existing algorithms for comparing ChIP-seq data 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A variety of methods have been proposed for comparing transcription factor
 binding sites from different ChIP-seq experiments.
 For example, by comparing the overlapping and non-overlapping genome regions
 using the peaks identified from individual ChIP-seq experiments, one can
 get an idea of the qualitative differences of the binding sites.
 One can also look at the “target” gene for each peak by annotating the
 peaks with the nearest genes, and look at the overlapping set of gene IDs
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "zheng_genetic_2010,odom_tissue-specific_2007"

\end_inset

.
 These approaches are useful to get an overall sense of the binding site
 similarities and differences, but it does not provide a sense of differential
 quantification.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MACS can perform a comparison of ChIP-seq experiments to find differential
 binding sites in addition to calling peaks on individual experiments.
 In order to find these differential binding sites, one ChIP-seq experiment
 is used as a false control data (instead of the typical use of a input
 DNA as a control), and another ChIP-seq experiment is used to compare against
 it as usual.
 Then, differential peaks are found when large peaks in the data are found
 to exceed the false control.
 This technique is possible because the background variation of the Poisson,
 assuming that the background variation is comparable across experiments.
 This method has some intuitive advantages for finding differential peaks,
 however, it does not satisfy some problems.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the problems with the approach that MACS uses is that it does not
 necessarily incorporate replicate data into its findings.
 To incorporate replicates into MACS, the reads from the replicate experiments
 can be pooled simply by concatenating the read files.
 Pooling replicate experiments will increase the “saturation” and total
 sequencing depth however it does not give you testing intuition that could
 be derived for replicate experiments.
 Alternatively, the overlapping or non-overlapping peaks from replicate
 experiments could be used to incorporate the high confidence peaks, however
 this still doesn’t necessarily increase confidence for these peaks since
 it will also increase the background noise.

\begin_layout Standard
Replicates have been shown to be important in measuring differential gene

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, and we considered methods that use similar techniques that would help
 us compare ChIP-seq data to find differential binding sites.
 The statistical problem that arises from doing comparisons from high-throughput
 data is the “small

, large 
\begin_inset Formula $p$

” problem.
 This problem exists because typically there are few samples (

Approach
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To tackle the problem of comparing these large high-throughput sequencing
 datasets for ChIP-seq data we first we did did exploratory analysis and
 setup data (2.1, 2.2, 2.3).
 We performed a simple normalization of our data using scaling by median
 read depth (2.4).
 Then we found evidence for differential binding sites by looking at the
 overlapping and non-overlapping peaks from different experiments (2.5,2.6).
 Finally, we evaluated the NormDiff algorithm 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 for comparing experiments (2.7).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Description of dataset
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We looked at ChIP-seq experiments for two different strains of yeast for
 a transcription factor Ste12 accessed from Zheng et al
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeyearpar
key "zheng_genetic_2010"

\end_inset

.
 The two different strains of yeast are called S96, which is isogenic to
 the reference S288c strain of “baker’s yeast”, and HS959, which is isogenic
 to the YJM789 strain (a clinical isolate)..
 The reads from both S96 and HS959 were aligned to the same reference genome,
 S288c, and these mapped short-read sequences are used by our algorithm.
 Aligning to the same reference genome makes a reasonable simplifying assumption
 about the similarity of both genomes.
 In this work we do not consider the alignment of the YJM789 genome to S288c
 for comparing the ChIP-seq reads.

In the original analysis of these genomes, Zheng et al.
 observed “extensive Ste12 binding variation among individuals”

\end_inset

.
 This variation refers to not only differences between the two parent strains,
 but also variations in the cross-strains from the parent strains.
 To show just the differences between the parent strains, Zheng et al.
 obtained the target genes for the binding sites that are found using MACS
 by annotating the peaks with the nearest gene ID.
 We wanted to reproduce these results in order to see if the binding site
 differences between the parent strains are found from non-overlapping gene
 IDs from the peak finding results.

Methods:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also used the published set of peaks that are called using MACS by Zheng
 et al for comparing the parent strains.
 Then we obtained peak set annotations by finding the nearest promoter ID
 from the nearest gene using annotations from the sacCer3 annotations.

\begin_layout Standard
We found similar results to the original work from the gene annotations
 of the peak set that Zheng et al.
 published (Figure 4).
 There is a similar distribution from the overlapping and non-overlapping
 gene IDs, with some additional overlapping sets and HS959 specific that
 might have been omitted from the published results.

Processing of data

\begin_layout Standard

Goal: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to do our own analysis of the ChIP-seq experiments, we needed to
 produce data that has a suitable format.
 When we analyze the data and obtain read counts, the format of the data
 is in ragged arrays with each chromosome having its own array.
 We joined the data from each array from all of the ChIP-seq experiments
 into a single data table to make comparing the data easier.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Method: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We counted the number of reads that overlap small non-overlapping bins of
 length n=10bp for each experiment over the whole genome.
 Then we merged the read counts from the bins from each experiment into
 a single data table using the familiar “inner-join” relationship, matching
 on genome position.
 Reads that have zero counts are considered missing data and they are omitted
 from the data table.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Result:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The result of joining the experiments together is a large data table with
 columns that correspond to the chromosome, genome position, and read counts
 for each experiment.
 We used approximately 118mb for this table (in memory) for the yeast ChIP-seq
 experiments, only including the parent strain replicates (genome size 1.2*10^7bp
, bin size n=10bp).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Caveat: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We use an inner-join of the read positions because empty bins are considered
 missing data, so we simply omit these from processing.
 Note that if we performed an outer-join instead of an inner-join, then
 it would include empty bins and they could be filled in with zero reads
 and it could be included for downstream processing.
 We omit these because have zero mapped reads normally indicates a problem
 with mappability of the genome, and because this causes problems with taking
 log-ratios of the genes.

\begin_layout Standard
The data from different ChIP-seq experiments have different total library
 sizes of the number of sequenced reads, and this can influence the results

 We wanted to normalize the data based on the median read depth so that
 the “background” distribution that represents the majority of the data
 would be equalized.

 of the median of each column’s distribution.
 Then, the difference between the column’s median and the average value
 over all columns is used to scale the read depth.

Interpretation: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After normalizing, the median values are equalized across all the experiment
 (Figure 4).
 The normalization has the effect of making the median read depths equal,
 but note that the median read depth is not necessarily correlated with
 the total library size.
 For example HS959rep1 has a greater average read depth but it does not
 have a larger library size (Table 1), which indicates that the enrichment
 of the ChIP protocol can vary across experiments causing different signal
 to noise ratios.

Caveats:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our method of equalizing the distributions based on median read depth might
 be seen as more aggressive than some other methods such as just scaling
 by the total library size, however, it is less aggressive than a full quantile
 normalization.
 Additionally, more sophisticated normalizations have been developed that
 can estimate the background

\begin_layout Standard
For each of the strains of yeast that Zheng et al used, at least two biological
 replicate experiments were performed using ChIP-seq.
 We specifically wanted to see if we could find any differences between
 the overlapping or non-overlapping peaks that were identified using MACS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Methods:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We used ChIP-seq read counts from bins with matching genome positions in
 two S96 replicates and compared the counts from the bins that are in the
 overlapping peaks and non-overlapping peaks.
 Note that bins with zero reads are excluded, but even bins with low read
 counts can fall within peak regions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Results:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We found that the read counts from the replicates have high correlation
 (ρ>0.9).
 With regard to the peak read counts, the non-overlapping peaks have smaller
 read counts compared with the read counts of the overlapping peaks.
 However, notably, even for the non-overlapping peaks, there do not appear
 to be large differences between read counts (

Interpretation:

\begin_layout Standard
From our analysis of the peaks from these replicates, even the non-overlapping
 peaks seem to have similar read counts based on our figure, which suggests
 that simply using the non-overlapping peaks to represent differences might
 be misrepresenting the data.
 Note that the reads from the replicate 1 appear higher in some of the peaks
 in replicate 2, and vice versa, because after normalizing for read depth
 across experiments, indicating that they might be a part of the background
 distribution

We wanted to compare the different strains of yeast to see if we could find
 differential binding sites from overlapping and non-overlapping peaks that
 are identified using MACS.
 This comparison might show more interesting features because, while the
 replicate experiments are genetic copies of each other, finding differences
 in the binding sites from different strains might show some functional
 or regulatory change in their genomes.

\begin_layout Standard
Similar to our analysis of the replicates, we used the read counts from
 the peaks called by MACS from one replicate from each strain and looked
 at how the read counts from overlapping and non-overlapping peaks compare.
 Also note that the ChIP-seq data from both strains is aligned to the same
 reference genome, so we use the same genome coordinates when comparing
 the experiments.

Noise and bias from high throughput experiments is often dealt with by comparing

 The control data itself can represent some biological features, for example,
 some studies have shown bias exists for sequencing of promoter regions

 and mappability

 To account for this, some methods have used background subtraction.
 NormDiff is an algorithm developed by Zheng et al.

 NormDiff also uses a scaling factor to account for differences in sequencing
 depth between the ChIP-seq and control libraries.
 Then the control data is subtracted from the ChIP-seq data (a background
 subtraction) and performs a normalization based on the estimated variance.
 In order to estimate the variance, NormDiff uses a “dynamic” estimation
 of the parameter from local regions surrounding each genome position, similar
 to MACS

 We used this algorithm to assess the fit of NormDiff to compare replicate
 ChIP-seq experiments from the S96 strain of yeast.
 Additionally, we looked at how NormDiff compares to other types of normalizatio
n such as background subtraction without normalization and a modified NormDiff
 with only global variance estimation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Result:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The result of these comparisons is that NormDiff with local variance estimation
 has better normalizing properties than the global variance estimation,
 or a comparison of reads without normalization, and it results in a less
 biased normalization than the other methods (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:MA-style-plots"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Interpretation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The NormDiff algorithm is well-suited to normalizing the “binding signal”
 and removes bias caused by differences in read depth and other variables.
 The result of the normalization can be made clear by observing that the
 total number of reads from replicate 1 is almost twice the number of reads
 from replicate 2 (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "tab:Listing-of-ChIP-seq"

\end_inset

).
 Even so, NormDiff effectively normalizes both experiments which can be
 seen by comparing the differences between all positions (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "fig:MA-style-plots"

\end_inset

).and observing that the least squares best fit line has slope close to zero
 (slope=0.02).
 NormDiff does not perform any between-experiment normalizations, but by
 estimating the binding signal and by performing a background subtraction,
 it tries to make the ChIP-seq experiments comparable.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Caveat: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One problem with NormDiff is that it has increased noise due to the additive
 effect of the variance in the background subtraction.
 While it controls the bias of the signal, it also increases the variance,
 which is known as the Bias-Variance trade-off.
 Since the quantitative trait should accurately measure the variance it’s
 possible that the background subtraction techniques introduce too much
 noise.

Two main features of Student's t-test should be noted for our application.
 The first is that the difference between the groups is estimated using
 the mean difference of the samples.
 In our application, the differences correspond to the log ratio of the
 read counts, because log(R/G)=log(R)-log(G).
 The second is that the t-test assumes that read counts are approximately
 normally distributed.

\begin_layout Standard
Even though these distributions log-ratios across the whole genome appear

 at a particular genome position across experiments.

Caveats: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall, the ordinary Student’s t-test is not well suited for our data for
 several reasons.
 One problem is that we have a small number of samples,so it is difficult
 to estimate the variance from the binned read counts at a particular genome
 position.
 Another problem is that the variance of the read counts is small for most
 of the genome because and this low variability causes problems.

 The moderated t-test “has the same interpretation as an ordinary t-statistic

 towards a common value, using a simple Bayesian model.”

 This addresses the issue of small sample size by using distribution of

We selected an arbitrary number of significantly differential read count

 Then nearby bins that are less than 20bp apart from each other that are

 Then we highlighted the selected positions in the strain vs strain comparison
 plot to show that the t-test finds significantly differential read counts.
 After merging the nearby bins from our selection, we obtained 158 unique
 differential peaks with FDR adjusted P-value <0.01.
 We inspected the signal tracks of the differential peaks by plotting the
 number of reads that overlap each genome position (

 Many of the differential binding sites are merged with nearby neighbors
 to produce differential peaks (

 The growth of the differential peak curve outpaces the number of differential

In our trial, with 50 iterations of the EM algorithm, DIME uses is not able

 Still, the results of the model can still be useful.
 The claim is made is that “applicability of DIME is greatly extended beyond
 uniform or exponential since any distribution can be well approximated
 by a mixture of normals” 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 DIME classified 20116 read count bins as differential, and after merging
 nearby read count bins, we identified 4280 differential binding sites (P<0.01).

Interpretation:

\begin_layout Standard
We used the iNUDGE model with K=2 normal components which shows a good model
 fit and use default sigma thresholds for identifying differential binding
 from the normal components.
 The differential components that are identified from the strain vs strain
 comparison plot are intuitively what we expect as differential.
 Additionally, we found some good differential peaks with reasonable confidence.
 One binding site we found with DIME shows a binding site that appears to
 have moved between one genome position to the other (

Statistical model:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
High-throughput sequencing data is based on read counts and these are typically
 considered discrete distributions.
 ChIP-seq programs have used a variety of statistical models that use discrete
 distributions such as Poisson
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 and negative binomial 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 We also compared other types of models of ChIP-seq data including DIME
 and limma 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

 which use continuous distributions based on mixed models and t-distributions
 respectively.
 DIME and limma do not necessarily represent the true underlying discrete
 distributions, so we took steps to show that we can still satisfy some
 of the demands by using QQ-plots.

\begin_layout Standard

Normalization:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Normalization has been important considerations for modeling the data, and
 both DIME and limma have taken some pains to model the mean and the variance
 using some custom techniques.
 Taslim et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeyearpar
key "taslim_comparative_2009"

\end_inset

 applied a two-step LOESS normalization to smooth the mean and the variance
 separately for comparing ChIP-seq data using DIME.
 Limma also has a method called voom: mean-variance modelling at the observation
al level, that is uses a LOESS curve to give weights for limma’s linear
 models.
 We did not employ these methods of normalization in favor of more simple
 normalization, scaling median read depth, but there is evidence that these
 are important for comparing across experiments.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Future work and considerations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Comparisons of ChIP-seq would be improved by better characterizing the variance
 of the binding sites across experiments.
 In our approach, we assume a normal distribution in order to apply a t-test,
 and while we showed a good fit, other distributions that represent the
 underlying discrete data can be used.
 One approach that MACS and others have used is to model the local variations
 of the ChIP-seq data across the genome.
 This method might be more effective than a whole-genome estimation of variance
 that limma uses.
 Others have shown that the Poisson is not as effective at modeling the
 overdispersion of the variance across experiments, and call for the use
 of a alternative statistical models

Properly normalizing and characterizing the binding signals from the noisy
 background would also improve the comparison of ChIP-seq data data and

 revealed local cis-factors and long-range trans-factors associated with
 variations in transcription factor binding by using NormDiff to quantify
 binding.
 NormDiff uses scaling by median read depth, but better normalization that
 is used to estimate the background noise separately from the read depth
 has been shown to be an effective for ChIP-seq data analysis.
 Applying these methods might help characterize the transcription factor
 binding sites from the noisy binding signals and reduce the need for background
 subtraction.

Finding the relationship between the binding site changes and gene expression

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Presently, we have shown how to compare ChIP-seq experiments using a statistical
 hypothesis testing approach that can identify significant differential
 binding sites.
 We are able to represent data in a simple way using binned read counts
 that allows ChIP-seq data to be quantitatively compared using efficient
 numerical algorithms.
 We used algorithms for detecting differential features from high-trhoguhput
 data using a moderated t-test from the limma package to find differential
 binding sites.
 By taking the most significant differences according to a moderated t-test
 method, and by merging some nearby positions that also ranked highly, we
 found differential peaks.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additional work to understand the regulatory functions of the genome is
 ongoing, including new types of epigenetic profiles using ChIP-seq, and
 differential peaks identification will be essential for comparing experiments.
 The ability to identify regulatory changes involves a broad spectrum of
 techniques including normalization, statistical modeling, and bioinformatics
 data analysis.
 The methods outlined here use well known and flexible techniques for identifyin
g differential features from high-throughput data and provides a flexible
 platform for analyzing different types of experiments.
