	abstract = {Next-generation {DNA} sequencing coupled with chromatin immunoprecipitation ({ChIP-seq)} is revolutionizing our ability to interrogate whole genome protein-{DNA} interactions. Identification of protein binding sites from {ChIP-seq} data has required novel computational tools, distinct from those used for the analysis of {ChIP-Chip} experiments. The growing popularity of {ChIP-seq} spurred the development of many different analytical programs (at last count, we noted 31 open source methods), each with some purported advantage. Given that the literature is dense and empirical benchmarking challenging, selecting an appropriate method for {ChIP-seq} analysis has become a daunting task. Herein we compare the performance of eleven different peak calling programs on common empirical, transcription factor datasets and measure their sensitivity, accuracy and usability. Our analysis provides an unbiased critical assessment of available technologies, and should assist researchers in choosing a suitable tool for handling {ChIP-seq} data.},

Here we review the recent progress in large-scale methods to determine protein-protein, genetic and chemical-genetic interaction networks. We discuss some of the limitations and advantages of the different methods and give examples of how these networks are being used to study the evolutionary process. Comparative studies have revealed that different types of protein-protein interactions diverge at different rates with high conservation of co-complex membership but rapid divergence of more promiscuous interactions like those that mediate post-translational modifications. These evolutionary trends have consistent genetic consequences with highly conserved epistatic interactions within complex subunits but faster divergence of epistatic interactions across complexes or pathways. Finally, we discuss how these evolutionary observations are being used to interpret cross-species chemical-genetic studies and how they might shape therapeutic strategies. Together, these interaction networks offer us an unprecedented level of detail into how genotypes are translated to phenotypes, and we envision that they will be increasingly useful in the interpretation of genetic and phenotypic variation occurring within populations as well as the rational design of combinatorial therapeutics.},

Here we present the first extensive map of human {DHSs} identified through genome-wide profiling in 125 diverse cell and tissue types. We identify {\textasciitilde}2.9 million {DHSs} that encompass virtually all known experimentally validated cis-regulatory sequences and expose a vast trove of novel elements, most with highly cell-selective regulation. Annotating these elements using {ENCODE} data reveals novel relationships between chromatin accessibility, transcription, {DNA} methylation and regulatory factor occupancy patterns. We connect {\textasciitilde}580,000 distal {DHSs} with their target promoters, revealing systematic pairing of different classes of distal {DHSs} and specific promoter types. Patterning of chromatin accessibility at many regulatory regions is organized with dozens to hundreds of co-activated elements, and the transcellular {DNase} I sensitivity pattern at a given region can predict cell-type-specific functional behaviours. The {DHS} landscape shows signatures of recent functional evolutionary constraint. However, the {DHS} compartment in pluripotent and immortalized cells exhibits higher mutation rates than that in highly differentiated cells, exposing an unexpected link between chromatin accessibility, proliferative potential and patterns of human variation.},

Here, we present a non-linear normalization algorithm and a mixture modeling method for comparing {ChIP-seq} data from multiple samples and characterizing genes based on their {RNA} polymerase {II} (Pol {II)} binding patterns.
Results: We apply a two-step non-linear normalization method based on locally weighted regression ({LOESS)} approach to compare {ChIP-seq} data across multiple samples and model the difference using an Exponential-{NormalK} mixture model. Fitted model is used to identify genes associated with differential binding sites based on local false discovery rate (fdr). These genes are then standardized and hierarchically clustered to characterize their Pol {II} binding patterns. As a case study, we apply the analysis procedure comparing normal breast cancer ({MCF7)} to tamoxifen-resistant ({OHT)} cell line. We find enriched regions that are associated with cancer (P {\textless} 0.0001). Our findings also imply that there may be a dysregulation of cell cycle and gene expression control pathways in the tamoxifen-resistant cells. These results show that the non-linear normalization method can be used to analyze {ChIP-seq} data across multiple samples.

	abstract = {The problem of identifying differentially expressed genes in designed microarray experiments is considered. Lonnstedt and Speed (2002) derived an expression for the posterior odds of differential expression in a replicated two-color experiment using a simple hierarchical parametric model. The purpose of this paper is to develop the hierarchical model of Lonnstedt and Speed (2002) into a practical approach for general microarray experiments with arbitrary numbers of treatments and {RNA} samples. The model is reset in the context of general linear models with arbitrary coefficients and contrasts of interest. The approach applies equally well to both single channel and two color microarray experiments. Consistent, closed form estimators are derived for the hyperparameters in the model. The estimators proposed have robust behavior even for small numbers of arrays and allow for incomplete data arising from spot filtering or spot quality weights. The posterior odds statistic is reformulated in terms of a moderated t-statistic in which posterior residual standard deviations are used in place of ordinary standard deviations. The empirical Bayes approach is equivalent to shrinkage of the estimated sample variances towards a pooled estimate, resulting in far more stable inference when the number of arrays is small. The use of moderated t-statistics has the advantage over the posterior odds that the number of hyperparameters which need to estimated is reduced; in particular, knowledge of the non-null prior for the fold changes are not required. The moderated t-statistic is shown to follow a t-distribution with augmented degrees of freedom. The moderated t inferential approach extends to accommodate tests of composite null hypotheses through the use of moderated F-statistics. The performance of the methods is demonstrated in a simulation study. Results are presented for two publicly available data sets.},

An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data. {AVAILABILITY:} The package is freely available under the {LGPL} licence from the Bioconductor web site (http://bioconductor.org).},

However, this method provides no means for verifying its success other than sequencing the putative mutant construct: This can quickly become an expensive method for screening for successful mutations. An alternative to sequencing is to simultaneously introduce a restriction site near the point mutation in manner such that the restriction site has no effect on the translated amino acid sequence. Thus, the novel restriction site can be used as a marker for successful mutation which can be quickly and easily assessed. However, finding a restriction site that does not disturb the corresponding amino acid sequence is a time-consuming task even for experienced researchers. A fast and easy to use computer program is needed for this task.},

 Annotating repetitive regions of genomes experimentally is a challenging task. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing ({ChIP-seq)} provides valuable data for characterizing repetitive regions of genomes in terms of transcription factor binding. Although {ChIP-seq} technology has been maturing, available {ChIP-seq} analysis methods and software rely on discarding sequence reads that map to multiple locations on the reference genome (multi-reads), thereby generating a missed opportunity for assessing transcription factor binding to highly repetitive regions of genomes. We develop a computational algorithm that takes multi-reads into account in {ChIP-seq} analysis. We show with computational experiments that multi-reads lead to significant increase in sequencing depths and identification of binding regions that are otherwise not identifiable when only reads that uniquely map to the reference genome (uni-reads) are used. In particular, we show that the number of binding regions identified can increase up to 36\%. We support our computational predictions with independent quantitative real-time {ChIP} validation of binding regions identified only when multi-reads are incorporated in the analysis of a mouse {GATA1} {ChIP-seq} experiment.},

The analysis of such experiments is nontrivial because of large data size and many levels of variation introduced at different stages of the experiments. The analysis is further complicated by the large differences that may exist among different probes used to interrogate the same gene. However, an attractive feature of high-density oligonucleotide arrays such as those produced by photolithography and inkjet technology is the standardization of chip manufacturing and hybridization process. As a result, probe-specific biases, although significant, are highly reproducible and predictable, and their adverse effect can be reduced by proper modeling and analysis methods. Here, we propose a statistical model for the probe-level data, and develop model-based estimates for gene expression indexes. We also present model-based methods for identifying and handling cross-hybridizing probes and contaminating array regions. Applications of these results will be presented elsewhere.},

One cis-regulatory element can regulate several genes,[2] and conversely, one gene can have several cis-regulatory modules.[3] Cis-regulatory modules are one of several types of functional regulatory elements. Regulatory elements are binding sites for transcription factors, which are involved in gene regulation.[1] Cis-regulatory modules perform a large amount of developmental information processing.[1] Cis-regulatory modules are non-random clusters at their specified target site that contain transcription factor binding sites.[1] They are labeled as cis because they are typically located on the same {DNA} as the genes they control as opposed to trans, which refers to effects on genes not located on the same strand or farther away, such as transcription factors.[1] The original definition presented cis-regulatory modules as enhancers of cis-acting {DNA}, which increased the rate of transcription from a linked promoter.[4] However, this definition has changed to define cis-regulatory modules as a {DNA} sequence with transcription factor binding sites which are clustered into modular structures, including -but not limited to- locus control regions, promoters, enhancers, silencers, boundary control elements and other modulators.[4] Cis-regulatory modules can be divided into classes. Enhancers regulate gene expression positively.[1] Insulators work indirectly by interacting with other nearby cis-regulatory modules.[1] Silencers act by silencing genes.[1] Cis-regulatory modules carry out their function by integrating the active transcription factors and the associated co-factors at a specific time and place in the cell, this information is read and an output is given.[4]},

With {siRNA} knockdown and viral overexpression in mouse liver, we demonstrate that Sort1 alters plasma {LDL-C} and very low-density lipoprotein ({VLDL)} particle levels by modulating hepatic {VLDL} secretion.

	abstract = {Motivation: Most methods of analyzing microarray data or doing power calculations have an underlying assumption of constant variance across all levels of gene expression. The most common transformation, the logarithm, results in data that have constant variance at high levels but not at low levels. Rocke and Durbin showed that data from spotted arrays fit a two-component model and Durbin, Hardin, Hawkins, and Rocke, Huber et al. and Munson provided a transformation that stabilizes the variance as well as symmetrizes and normalizes the error structure. We wish to evaluate the applicability of this transformation to the error structure of {GeneChip} microarrays.
Results: We demonstrate in an example study a simple way to use the two-component model of Rocke and Durbin and the data transformation of Durbin, Hardin, Hawkins and Rocke, Huber et al. and Munson on Affymetrix {GeneChip} data. In addition we provide a method for normalization of Affymetrix {GeneChips} simultaneous with the determination of the transformation, producing a data set without chip or slide effects but with constant variance and with symmetric errors. This transformation/normalization process can be thought of as a machine calibration in that it requires a few biologically constant replicates of one sample to determine the constant needed to specify the transformation and normalize. It is hypothesized that this constant needs to be found only once for a given technology in a lab, perhaps with periodic updates. It does not require extensive replication in each study. Furthermore, the variance of the transformed pilot data can be used to do power calculations using standard power analysis programs.
Availability: {SPLUS} code for the transformation/normalization for four replicates is available from the first author upon request. A program written in C is available from the last author.},

To this end, the occurrence of social deficits and mitochondrial outcomes were evaluated in conditional Pten (Phosphatase and tensin homolog) haplo-insufficient mice, in which only one allele was selectively knocked-out in neural tissues. Pten mutations have been linked to Alzheimer's disease and syndromic autism spectrum disorders, among others. By 4-6 weeks of age, Pten insufficiency resulted in the increase of several mitochondrial Complex activities ({II-III}, {IV} and V) not accompanied by increases in mitochondrial mass, consistent with an activation of the {PI3K/Akt} pathway, of which Pten is a negative modulator. At 8-13 weeks of age, Pten haplo-insufficient mice did not show significant behavioral abnormalities or changes in mitochondrial outcomes, but by 20-29 weeks, they displayed aberrant social behavior (social avoidance, failure to recognize familiar mouse, and repetitive self-grooming), macrocephaly, increased oxidative stress, decreased cytochrome c oxidase ({CCO)} activity (50\%) and increased {mtDNA} deletions in cerebellum and hippocampus. Mitochondrial dysfunction was the result of a downregulation of p53-signaling pathway evaluated by lower protein expression of p21 (65\% of controls) and the {CCO} chaperone {SCO2} (47\% of controls), two p53-downstream targets. This mechanism was confirmed in Pten-deficient striatal neurons and, {HCT} 116 cells with different p53 gene dosage. These results suggest a unique pathogenic mechanism of the Pten-p53 axis in mice with aberrant social behavior: loss of Pten (via p53) impairs mitochondrial function elicited by an early defective assembly of {CCO} and later enhanced by the accumulation of {mtDNA} deletions. Consistent with our results, (i) {SCO2} deficiency and/or {CCO} activity defects have been reported in patients with learning disabilities including autism and (ii) mutated proteins in {ASD} have been found associated with p53-signaling pathways.},

Although the uniporter’s biophysical properties have been studied extensively, its molecular composition remains elusive. We recently used comparative proteomics to identify {MICU1} (also known as {CBARA1)}, an {EF-hand-containing} protein that serves as a putative regulator of the uniporter. Here, we use whole-genome phylogenetic profiling, genome-wide {RNA} co-expression analysis and organelle-wide protein coexpression analysis to predict proteins functionally related to {MICU1.} All three methods converge on a novel predicted transmembrane protein, {CCDC109A}, that we now call ‘mitochondrial calcium uniporter’ ({MCU).} {MCU} forms oligomers in the mitochondrial inner membrane, physically interacts with {MICU1}, and resides within a large molecular weight complex. Silencing {MCU} in cultured cells or in vivo in mouse liver severely abrogates mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, whereas mitochondrial respiration and membrane potential remain fully intact. {MCU} has two predicted transmembrane helices, which are separated by a highly conserved linker facing the intermembrane space. Acidic residues in this linker are required for its full activity. However, an {S259A} point mutation retains function but confers resistance to Ru360, the most potent inhibitor of the uniporter. Our genomic, physiological, biochemical and pharmacological data firmly establish {MCU} as an essential component of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter.},

	abstract = {1. The thermodynamics and molecular basis of energy-linked conformational changes in the cytochrome aa3 and {ATP} synthetase complexes of the mitochondrial membrane have been studied with spectrophotometrical and fluorometrical techniques. 2. Ferric cytochrome aa3 exists in two conformations, high spin and low spin, the equilibrium between these states being controlled by the electrical potential difference across the mitochondrial membrane. The conformational change is brought about by an electrical field-driven binding of one proton per aa3 to the complex. At {pH} 7.2 the concentration of the two conformations is equal at a membrane potential of 170 {mV} corresponding to about 4 kcal/mole. 3. The high to low spin transition in ferric aa3 is also induced by hydrolysis of {ATP} in which case two molecules of aa3 are shifted per {ATP} molecule hydrolyzed. This is in accordance with translocation of two protons across the mitochondrial membrane coupled to hydrolysis of {ATP} as proposed in the chemiosmotic theory of oxidative phosphorylation. 4. The conformational transition in cytochrome aa3 is not an expression of the formation of a 'high-energy' intermediate or reversal of the energy-transducing pathway of oxidative phosphorylation, but is presumably the basis of allosteric control of the activity of cytochrome oxidase by the energy state of the mitochondrion. This control is exerted by a regulatory mechanism in which the electrical potential difference controls the conformation and redox properties of the heme centres and thereby the rate of oxygen consumption. 5. The synthesis of one molecule of {ATP} by oxidative phosphorylation is energetically equivalent to the work done in carrying two electrical charges across the entire mitochondrial membrane. 6. Fluorescence changes of aurovertin bound to {ATP} synthetase reveal that the electrical membrane potential induces a conformational change in the F1 portion of the enzyme which is probably associated with dissociation of the natural F1 inhibitor protein. This conformational change is energetically equivalent to the work done in carrying one electrical charge across the mitochondrial membrane. 7. A model is proposed for the mechanism of the electrical field-induced conformational changes in the cytochrome aa3 and {ATP} synthetase complexes, and the significance of these changes in the mechanism and control of mitochondrial energy conservation is discussed.},

Gene-distal enhancers are critical for tissue-specific gene expression, but their genomic determinants within a specific lineage at different stages of development are unknown. Here we profile chromatin state maps, transcription factor occupancy, and gene expression profiles during human erythroid development at fetal and adult stages. Comparative analyses of human erythropoiesis identify developmental stage-specific enhancers as primary determinants of stage-specific gene expression programs. We find that erythroid master regulators {GATA1} and {TAL1} act cooperatively within active enhancers but confer little predictive value for stage specificity. Instead, a set of stage-specific coregulators collaborates with master regulators and contributes to differential gene expression. We further identify and validate {IRF2}, {IRF6}, and {MYB} as effectors of an adult-stage expression program. Thus, the combinatorial assembly of lineage-specific master regulators and transcriptional coregulators within developmental stage-specific enhancers determines gene expression programs and temporal regulation of transcriptional networks in a mammalian genome.},

	abstract = {{CONTEXT}

Impaired mitochondrial function may influence processes highly dependent on energy, such as neurodevelopment, and contribute to autism. No studies have evaluated mitochondrial dysfunction and mitochondrial {DNA} ({mtDNA)} abnormalities in a well-defined population of children with autism.


{OBJECTIVE}

To evaluate mitochondrial defects in children with autism.


{DESIGN}, {SETTING}, {AND} {PATIENTS}

Observational study using data collected from patients aged 2 to 5 years who were a subset of children participating in the Childhood Autism Risk From Genes and Environment study in California, which is a population-based, case-control investigation with confirmed autism cases and age-matched, genetically unrelated, typically developing controls, that was launched in 2003 and is still ongoing. Mitochondrial dysfunction and {mtDNA} abnormalities were evaluated in lymphocytes from 10 children with autism and 10 controls.


{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}

Oxidative phosphorylation capacity, {mtDNA} copy number and deletions, mitochondrial rate of hydrogen peroxide production, and plasma lactate and pyruvate.


{RESULTS}

The reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ({NADH)} oxidase activity (normalized to citrate synthase activity) in lymphocytic mitochondria from children with autism was significantly lower compared with controls (mean, 4.4 [95\% confidence interval {\{CI\}}, 2.8-6.0] vs 12 [95\% {CI}, 8-16], respectively; P = .001). The majority of children with autism (6 of 10) had complex I activity below control range values. Higher plasma pyruvate levels were found in children with autism compared with controls (0.23 {mM} [95\% {CI}, 0.15-0.31 {mM]} vs 0.08 {mM} [95\% {CI}, 0.04-0.12 {mM]}, respectively; P = .02). Eight of 10 cases had higher pyruvate levels but only 2 cases had higher lactate levels compared with controls. These results were consistent with the lower pyruvate dehydrogenase activity observed in children with autism compared with controls (1.0 [95\% {CI}, 0.6-1.4] nmol × [min × mg protein](-1) vs 2.3 [95\% {CI}, 1.7-2.9] nmol × [min × mg protein](-1), respectively; P = .01). Children with autism had higher mitochondrial rates of hydrogen peroxide production compared with controls (0.34 [95\% {CI}, 0.26-0.42] nmol × [min × mg of protein](-1) vs 0.16 [95\% {CI}, 0.12-0.20] nmol × [min × mg protein](-1) by complex {III;} P = .02). Mitochondrial {DNA} overreplication was found in 5 cases (mean ratio of {mtDNA} to nuclear {DNA:} 239 [95\% {CI}, 217-239] vs 179 [95\% {CI}, 165-193] in controls; P = 10(-4)). Deletions at the segment of cytochrome b were observed in 2 cases (ratio of cytochrome b to {ND1:} 0.80 [95\% {CI}, 0.68-0.92] vs 0.99 [95\% {CI}, 0.93-1.05] for controls; P = .01).


{CONCLUSION}

In this exploratory study, children with autism were more likely to have mitochondrial dysfunction, {mtDNA} overreplication, and {mtDNA} deletions than typically developing children.},

Did Christopher Columbus and his men introduce this pathogen into Renaissance Europe, after contracting it during their voyage to the New World? Or does syphilis have a much older history in the Old World? This paper represents the first attempt to use a phylogenetic approach to solve this question. In addition, it clarifies the evolutionary relationships between the pathogen that causes syphilis and the other T. pallidum subspecies, which cause the neglected tropical diseases yaws and endemic syphilis. Using a collection of pathogenic Treponema strains that is unprecedented in size, we show that yaws appears to be an ancient infection in humans while venereal syphilis arose relatively recently in human history. In addition, the closest relatives of syphilis-causing strains identified in this study were found in South America, providing support for the Columbian theory of syphilis's origin.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.0216},
	abstract = {To better characterize how variation in regulatory sequences drives divergence in gene expression, we undertook a systematic study of transcription factor binding and gene expression in the blastoderm embryos of four species that sample much of the diversity in the 60 million-year old genus Drosophila: D. melanogaster, D. yakuba, D. pseudoobscura and D. virilis. We compared gene expression, as measured by {mRNA-seq} to the genome-wide binding of four transcription factors involved in early development, as measured by {ChIP-seq} (Bicoid, Giant, Hunchback and Kr{\textbackslash}"uppel). Surprisingly, we found that {mRNA} levels are much better conserved than individual binding events. We looked at binding characteristics that may explain such evolutionary disparity. As expected, we found that binding divergence increases with phylogenetic distance. Interestingly, binding events in non-coding regions that were bound strongly by single factors, or bound by multiple factors, were more likely to be conserved. As this class of sites are most likely to be involved in gene regulation, the divergence of other bound regions may simply reflect their lack of function. We used a model of quantitative trait evolution to compare the changes of gene expression with nearby regulatory {TF} binding. We found that changes in gene expression were poorly explained by changes in associated {TF} binding. These results suggest that some of the differences in sequence and binding have limited effect on gene expression or act in a compensatory manner to maintain the overall expression levels of regulated genes.},

Bound locations are detectable as peak pairs by deep sequencing. Contaminating {DNA} is degraded or fails to form complementary peak pairs.

In these experiments, chromatin immunoprecipitation is used to enrich for particular {DNA} sequences of interest and signature sequencing is used to map the regions to the genome ({ChIP-Seq).} Elucidation of these sites of {DNA-protein} binding/modification are proving instrumental in reconstructing networks of gene regulation and chromatin remodelling that direct development, response to cellular perturbation, and neoplastic transformation.
{RESULTS:} Here we present a package of algorithms and software that makes use of control input data to reduce false positives and estimate confidence in {ChIP-Seq} peaks. Several different methods were compared using two simulated spike-in datasets. Use of control input data and a normalized difference score were found to more than double the recovery of {ChIP-Seq} peaks at a 5\% false discovery rate ({FDR).} Moreover, both a binomial p-value/q-value and an empirical {FDR} were found to predict the true {FDR} within 2-3 fold and are more reliable estimators of confidence than a global Poisson p-value.

In order to examine the consequences of gene expression variability in multicellular organisms, we studied intestinal specification in the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans in which wild-type cell fate is invariant and controlled by a small transcriptional network. Mutations in elements of this network can have indeterminate effects: some mutant embryos fail to develop intestinal cells, while others produce intestinal precursors. By counting transcripts of the genes in this network in individual embryos, we show that the expression of an otherwise redundant gene becomes highly variable in the mutants and that this variation is thresholded to produce an {ON/OFF} expression pattern of the master regulatory gene of intestinal differentiation. Our results demonstrate that mutations in developmental networks can expose otherwise buffered stochastic variability in gene expression, leading to pronounced phenotypic variation.},

	abstract = {With the increase in genomewide experiments and the sequencing of multiple genomes, the analysis of large data sets has become commonplace in biology. It is often the case that thousands of features in a genomewide data set are tested against some null hypothesis, where a number of features are expected to be significant. Here we propose an approach to measuring statistical significance in these genomewide studies based on the concept of the false discovery rate. This approach offers a sensible balance between the number of true and false positives that is automatically calibrated and easily interpreted. In doing so, a measure of statistical significance called the q value is associated with each tested feature. The q value is similar to the well known p value, except it is a measure of significance in terms of the false discovery rate rather than the false positive rate. Our approach avoids a flood of false positive results, while offering a more liberal criterion than what has been used in genome scans for linkage.},

	abstract = {In this paper we report exploratory analyses of high-density oligonucleotide array data from the Affymetrix {GeneChip} system with the objective of improving upon currently used measures of gene expression. Our analyses make use of three data sets: a small experimental study consisting of five {MGU74A} mouse {GeneChip} arrays, part of the data from an extensive spike-in study conducted by Gene Logic and Wyeth's Genetics Institute involving 95 {HG-U95A} human {GeneChip} arrays; and part of a dilution study conducted by Gene Logic involving 75 {HG-U95A} {GeneChip} arrays. We display some familiar features of the perfect match and mismatch probe ({PM} and {MM)} values of these data, and examine the variance-mean relationship with probe-level data from probes believed to be defective, and so delivering noise only. We explain why we need to normalize the arrays to one another using probe level intensities. We then examine the behavior of the {PM} and {MM} using spike-in data and assess three commonly used summary measures: Affymetrix's (i) average difference ({AvDiff)} and (ii) {MAS} 5.0 signal, and (iii) the Li and Wong multiplicative model-based expression index ({MBEI).} The exploratory data analyses of the probe level data motivate a new summary measure that is a robust multi-array average ({RMA)} of background-adjusted, normalized, and log-transformed {PM} values. We evaluate the four expression summary measures using the dilution study data, assessing their behavior in terms of bias, variance and (for {MBEI} and {RMA)} model fit. Finally, we evaluate the algorithms in terms of their ability to detect known levels of differential expression using the spike-in data. We conclude that there is no obvious downside to using {RMA} and attaching a standard error ({SE)} to this quantity using a linear model which removes probe-specific affinities.},

The goal of this paper is to develop effective statistical tools to identify genomic loci that show transcriptional or protein binding patterns of interest.
{RESULTS:} A two-step approach is proposed and is implemented in {TileMap.} In the first step, a test-statistic is computed for each probe based on a hierarchical empirical Bayes model. In the second step, the test-statistics of probes within a genomic region are used to infer whether the region is of interest or not. Hierarchical empirical Bayes model shrinks variance estimates and increases sensitivity of the analysis. It allows complex multiple sample comparisons that are essential for the study of temporal and spatial patterns of hybridization across different experimental conditions. Neighboring probes are combined through a moving average method ({MA)} or a hidden Markov model ({HMM).} Unbalanced mixture subtraction is proposed to provide approximate estimates of false discovery rate for {MA} and model parameters for {HMM.}

Results: Nebula was designed for both bioinformaticians and biologists. It is based on the Galaxy open source framework. Galaxy already includes a large number of functionalities for mapping reads and peak calling. We added the following to Galaxy: (i) peak calling with {FindPeaks} and a module for immunoprecipitation quality control, (ii) de novo motif discovery with {ChIPMunk}, (iii) calculation of the density and the cumulative distribution of peak locations relative to gene transcription start sites, (iv) annotation of peaks with genomic features and (v) annotation of genes with peak information. Nebula generates the graphs and the enrichment statistics at each step of the process. During Steps 3–5, Nebula optionally repeats the analysis on a control dataset and compares these results with those from the main dataset. Nebula can also incorporate gene expression (or gene modulation) data during these steps. In summary, Nebula is an innovative web service that provides an advanced {ChIP-seq} analysis pipeline providing ready-to-publish results.

The application of a classical method of data normalization, Z score transformation, provides a way of standardizing data across a wide range of experiments and allows the comparison of microarray data independent of the original hybridization intensities. Data normalized by Z score transformation can be used directly in the calculation of significant changes in gene expression between different samples and conditions. We used Z scores to compare several different methods for predicting significant changes in gene expression including fold changes, Z ratios, Z and t statistical tests. We conclude that the Z score transformation normalization method accompanied by either Z ratios or Z tests for significance estimates offers a useful method for the basic analysis of microarray data. The results provided by these methods can be as rigorous and are no more arbitrary than other test methods, and, in addition, they have the advantage that they can be easily adapted to standard spreadsheet programs.},

Study of these diseases has been limited by an inability to sequence expanded {CGG} repeats, particularly in the full mutation range, with existing {DNA} sequencing technologies. Single molecule real time ({SMRT)} sequencing provides an approach to sequencing that is fundamentally different from other "next-generation" sequencing platforms, and is well suited for long, repetitive {DNA} sequences. We report the first sequence data for expanded {CGG-repeat} {FMR1} alleles in the full mutation range that reveal the confounding effects of {CGG-repeat} tracts on both cloning and {PCR.} A unique feature of {SMRT} sequencing is its ability to yield real-time information on the rates of nucleoside addition by the tethered {DNA} polymerase; for the {CGG-repeat} alleles, we find a strand-specific effect of {CGG-repeat} {DNA} on the inter-pulse distance. This kinetic signature reveals a novel aspect of the repeat element; namely, that the particular G bias within the {CGG/CCG-repeat} element influences polymerase activity in a manner that extends beyond simple nearest-neighbor effects. These observations provide a baseline for future kinetic studies of repeat elements, as well as for studies of epigenetic and other chemical modifications thereof.},

	abstract = {Transcription factors bind in a combinatorial fashion to specify the on-and-off states of genes; the ensemble of these binding events forms a regulatory network, constituting the wiring diagram for a cell. To examine the principles of the human transcriptional regulatory network, we determined the genomic binding information of 119 transcription-related factors in over 450 distinct experiments. We found the combinatorial, co-association of transcription factors to be highly context specific: distinct combinations of factors bind at specific genomic locations. In particular, there are significant differences in the binding proximal and distal to genes. We organized all the transcription factor binding into a hierarchy and integrated it with other genomic information (for example, {microRNA} regulation), forming a dense meta-network. Factors at different levels have different properties; for instance, top-level transcription factors more strongly influence expression and middle-level ones co-regulate targets to mitigate information-flow bottlenecks. Moreover, these co-regulations give rise to many enriched network motifs (for example, noise-buffering feed-forward loops). Finally, more connected network components are under stronger selection and exhibit a greater degree of allele-specific activity (that is, differential binding to the two parental alleles). The regulatory information obtained in this study will be crucial for interpreting personal genome sequences and understanding basic principles of human biology and disease.},

	abstract = {Variation in transcriptional regulation is thought to be a major cause of phenotypic diversity. Although widespread differences in gene expression among individuals of a species have been observed, studies to examine the variability of transcription factor binding on a global scale have not been performed, and thus the extent and underlying genetic basis of transcription factor binding diversity is unknown. By mapping differences in transcription factor binding among individuals, here we present the genetic basis of such variation on a genome-wide scale. Whole-genome Ste12-binding profiles were determined using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with {DNA} sequencing in pheromone-treated cells of 43 segregants of a cross between two highly diverged yeast strains and their parental lines. We identified extensive Ste12-binding variation among individuals, and mapped underlying cis- and trans-acting loci responsible for such variation. We showed that most transcription factor binding variation is cis-linked, and that many variations are associated with polymorphisms residing in the binding motifs of Ste12 as well as those of several proposed Ste12 cofactors. We also identified two trans-factors, {AMN1} and {FLO8}, that modulate Ste12 binding to promoters of more than ten genes under α-factor treatment. Neither of these two genes was previously known to regulate Ste12, and we suggest that they may be mediators of gene activity and phenotypic diversity. Ste12 binding strongly correlates with gene expression for more than 200 genes, indicating that binding variation is functional. Many of the variable-bound genes are involved in cell wall organization and biogenesis. Overall, these studies identified genetic regulators of molecular diversity among individuals and provide new insights into mechanisms of gene regulation.},

In particular, sequencing {DNA} from the immunoprecipitation of protein-{DNA} complexes ({ChIP-seq)} and methylated {DNA} ({MeDIP-seq)} can reveal the locations of protein binding sites and epigenetic modifications. These approaches contain numerous biases which may significantly influence the interpretation of the resulting data. Rigorous computational methods for detecting and removing such biases are still lacking. Also, multi-sample normalization still remains an important open problem. This theoretical paper systematically characterizes the biases and properties of {ChIP-seq} data by comparing 62 separate publicly available datasets, using rigorous statistical models and signal processing techniques. Statistical methods for separating {ChIP-seq} signal from background noise, as well as correcting enrichment test statistics for sequence-dependent and sonication biases, are presented. Our method effectively separates reads into signal and background components prior to normalization, improving the signal-to-noise ratio. Moreover, most peak callers currently use a generic null model which suffers from low specificity at the sensitivity level requisite for detecting subtle, but true, {ChIP} enrichment. The proposed method of determining a cell type-specific null model, which accounts for cell type-specific biases, is shown to be capable of achieving a lower false discovery rate at a given significance threshold than current methods.},

As the cost of sequencing is decreasing, many researchers are switching from microarray-based technologies ({ChIP-chip)} to {ChIP-Seq} for genome-wide study of transcriptional regulation. Despite its increasing and well-deserved popularity, there is little work that investigates and accounts for sources of biases in the {ChIP-Seq} technology. These biases typically arise from both the standard preprocessing protocol and the underlying {DNA} sequence of the generated data. We study data from a naked {DNA} sequencing experiment, which sequences noncross-linked {DNA} after deproteinizing and shearing, to understand factors affecting background distribution of data generated in a {ChIP-Seq} experiment. We introduce a background model that accounts for apparent sources of biases such as mappability and {GC} content and develop a flexible mixture model named {MOSAiCS} for detecting peaks in both one- and two-sample analyses of {ChIP-Seq} data. We illustrate that our model fits observed {ChIP-Seq} data well and further demonstrate advantages of {MOSAiCS} over commonly used tools for {ChIP-Seq} data analysis with several case studies.

	abstract = {Regulatory factor binding to genomic {DNA} protects the underlying sequence from cleavage by {DNase} I, leaving nucleotide-resolution footprints. Using genomic {DNase} I footprinting across 41 diverse cell and tissue types, we detected 45 million transcription factor occupancy events within regulatory regions, representing differential binding to 8.4 million distinct short sequence elements. Here we show that this small genomic sequence compartment, roughly twice the size of the exome, encodes an expansive repertoire of conserved recognition sequences for {DNA-binding} proteins that nearly doubles the size of the human cis–regulatory lexicon. We find that genetic variants affecting allelic chromatin states are concentrated in footprints, and that these elements are preferentially sheltered from {DNA} methylation. High-resolution {DNase} I cleavage patterns mirror nucleotide-level evolutionary conservation and track the crystallographic topography of {protein–DNA} interfaces, indicating that transcription factor structure has been evolutionarily imprinted on the human genome sequence. We identify a stereotyped 50-base-pair footprint that precisely defines the site of transcript origination within thousands of human promoters. Finally, we describe a large collection of novel regulatory factor recognition motifs that are highly conserved in both sequence and function, and exhibit cell-selective occupancy patterns that closely parallel major regulators of development, differentiation and pluripotency.},
