TODO

-Analyze replicates in SOFTWARE
-Analyze linkage maps
-Include zscores in wiggleclass member variables

Binding site specific conservation model
Compare sequences to empirical chip-seq data comparisons
Use scaffolding from yeast



 
 Notes
Poisson - number of reads centered at a tag?
Read eland data manually instead of wiggle file?
Use MACS R script output?
 
 
 Normalize between experiments
 Random sampling needed for random testing
 Will add confirmation to results!!!!!?>????
 
 Compare results to differential binding.
Differential binding vs variable binding region


 
Create tdd framework?
Post-poster TODO list
 Analyze linkage
 Compare linkage map to linkage analysis
 Use of genetic markers (what is a single marker regression?)
 Statistical significance of linkage map (population variances)







TODO
Investigate Transgressive inheritance score (Zheng et al. 2010)
- stddev of normdiff scores of segregants divided by the difference of scores in parental strains
$var(Z)/(Z_p1-Z_p2)$

IMPLEMENT VARIABLE REGIONS
IMPLEMENT CONSE



High level


- Evaluate MAnorm on dataset
- Evaluate more "normalization and bias" models on dataset
- MAnorm says that 'sampling background' is arbitrary, as s/n ratios may differ. This is an important point
- What about the "significance of ChIP-seq data similarity". Statistics involved
Get todo.txt.net
- Since these are poisson how is normalization applied (fractional =??)

=====================
Done list



✓ Figure out QQ plot
✓ do peak finding using Z score?

 Poster todo
✓ plot P(x<=X) normdiff scores for syntenic
✓ -log10(pvalue)
✗ cutoff pvalue at same value as MACS?








# Can't upload anything to RESEARCH COMPUTING?? (2gb limit)
# Evaluate MANORM pairwise on replicates  (new paper?)
# Concatenate replicate data into one file (done)
# Compare results (galaxy)
# Fix many roman numeral sequences (fixed)
# Figure out correct regex
TODO
Galaxy workflow
Fix normdiff (including window sizes)
Generate new plots
Fix S4????





10/28
todo
- get max avg normdiff score WORKING
- get mod diff score WORKING
- output max avg normdiff score for peaks into FILE
- quick & dirty is to output syntenic regions of a given peak list
10/29
- validate low levels of expression in replicates??
