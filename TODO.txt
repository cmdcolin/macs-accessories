Testing
Compare different genomes using LIFTOVER for specific chip-seq binding sites? Leverage conservation?
1) What is the precedent for this (not obvious from google search)
2) What would be important for doing this in practice

Include zscores in wiggleclass member variables

✓ Subtract control
✓ Use Z score
✓ do peak finding using Z score?
✓ use techniques from MACS on Z score?



 I am trying to detect signals in a experiment that has experiment and control data. The control data is basically 'background noise', and  I want to use a algorithm called NormDiff that subtracts the control data away and normalizes the data. When i applied that algorithm the data isn't actually normal, and those strong signals appear as outliers (see pic). Is there a good way to detect those outliers?
 
 
 Bayes-data derived from the same "class"?
 
 Poisson - number of reads centered at a tag. 
 
 Background lambda for Normal!!!
 Use regular Z-score???
 
 Is the background lambda S Normal(0,1)?
 ****************Use hypothesis testing with MEAN and VARIANCE different from 0,1

 normalize between samples
 
 
✓ plot P(x<=X) normdiff scores for syntenic
✓ -log10(pvalue)
✗ cutoff pvalue at same value as MACS?
  We do not get the same pvalue as MACS (considerably less confidence values)
 
 
 
 
 Since NormDiff effectively normalizes ChIP-seq data,  it is suitable for comparing ChIP-seq data from multiple experiments. 
 
 
 Normalize between experiments
 - Zheng et al do not!!
 
 Random sampling needed for random testing
