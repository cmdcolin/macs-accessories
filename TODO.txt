Testing
Compare different genomes using LIFTOVER for specific chip-seq binding sites? Leverage conservation?
1) What is the precedent for this (not obvious from google search)
2) What would be important for doing this in practice


✗Analyze replicates in SOFTWARE
✗ Analyze linkage maps
✗ Include zscores in wiggleclass member variables
✗ Figure out better bayesian

✓ Figure out QQ plot
✓ do peak finding using Z score?

Binding site specific conservation model
Compare sequences to empirical chip-seq data comparisons
Use scaffolding from yeast



 
 Notes
Poisson - number of reads centered at a tag. 
Read eland data manually and use MACS R script outputted?
 
Background lambda for Normal vs Negative Binomial?
Compare to Negative binomial (i.e. mean, variance)
Is the background lambda S Normal(0,1)?
 
****************Use hypothesis testing with MEAN and VARIANCE different from 0,1

 
 
 Normalize between experiments
 Random sampling needed for random testing
 Will add confirmation to results!!!!!?>????
 
 Compare results to differential binding.
Differential binding vs variable binding region


 Poster todo
✓ plot P(x<=X) normdiff scores for syntenic
✓ -log10(pvalue)
✗ cutoff pvalue at same value as MACS?
When done considerably less confidence values (0.01 vs 1e-5) is there an issue there?
 

 
Create tdd framework?
Post-poster TODO list
 Analyze linkage
 Compare linkage map to linkage analysis
 Use of genetic markers (what is a single marker regression?)
 Statistical significance of linkage map (population variances)







TODO July
Investigate Transgressive inheritance score from Zheng et al.
- stddev of segregants divided by the difference of scores in parental strains
