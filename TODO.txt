Testing
Compare different genomes using LIFTOVER for specific chip-seq binding sites? Leverage conservation?
1) What is the precedent for this (not obvious from google search)
2) What would be important for doing this in practice

Data mining

 I am trying to detect signals in a experiment that has experiment and control data. The control data is basically 'background noise', and  I want to use a algorithm called NormDiff that subtracts the control data away and normalizes the data. When i applied that algorithm the data isn't actually normal, and those strong signals appear as outliers (see pic). Is there a good way to detect those outliers?
 
 Notes
 
Bayes-data derived from the same "class"?
Poisson - number of reads centered at a tag. 
Possible todo: read eland data manually and use MACS R script outputted
 
Background lambda for Normal
Compare to Negative binomial (mean, variance)
Is the background lambda S Normal(0,1)?
 
****************Use hypothesis testing with MEAN and VARIANCE different from 0,1
 
 Poster todo
✓ plot P(x<=X) normdiff scores for syntenic
✓ -log10(pvalue)
✗ cutoff pvalue at same value as MACS?
We do not get the same pvalue as MACS (considerably less confidence values)
 
 
 
 
 Since NormDiff effectively normalizes ChIP-seq data,  it is suitable for comparing ChIP-seq data from multiple experiments.

 start writing paper
 - Include what has been done (synthesize)
 - Include what should be done (hypothesize)
 - Change goals from normalization, bias correction (this work has been overdone clearly, need to answer a new question)
 - Formulate in terms of research goals
