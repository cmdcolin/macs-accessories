Testing
Compare different genomes using LIFTOVER for specific chip-seq binding sites? Leverage conservation?
1) What is the precedent for this (not obvious from google search)
2) What would be important for doing this in practice


✗Analyze replicates in SOFTWARE
✗ Analyze linkage maps
✗ Include zscores in wiggleclass member variables
✗ Figure out better bayesian

✓ Figure out QQ plot
✓ do peak finding using Z score?


Binding site specific conservation model
Compare sequences to empirical chip-seq data comparisons
Use scaffolding from yeast



 
 Notes
Poisson - number of reads centered at a tag. 
Read eland data manually and use MACS R script outputted?
 
Background lambda for Normal vs Negative Binomial?
Compare to Negative binomial (i.e. mean, variance)
Is the background lambda S Normal(0,1)?
 
****************Use hypothesis testing with MEAN and VARIANCE different from 0,1

 
 
 Normalize between experiments
 Random sampling needed for random testing
 Will add confirmation to results!!!!!?>????
 
 Compare results to differential binding.
Differential binding vs variable binding region


 Poster todo
✓ plot P(x<=X) normdiff scores for syntenic
✓ -log10(pvalue)
✗ cutoff pvalue at same value as MACS?
When done considerably less confidence values (0.01 vs 1e-5) is there an issue there?
 

 
Post-poster TODO list
 Analyze linkage
 Compare linkage map to linkage analysis
 Use of genetic markers (what is a single marker regression?)
 Statistical significance of linkage map (population variances)
 start writing paper
 - Include what has been done (synthesize)
 - Include what should be done (hypothesize)
 - Change goals from normalization, bias correction (this work has been overdone clearly, need to answer a new question)
 - Formulate in terms of research goals
 






TODO July
Investigate Transgressive inheritance
- Difference of parental strains divided by stddev of segregants
- Low scores (<3) is mandelian
Possibilities - If the difference is high, and then the variance will be high also. However, if the difference is high and the variance is low then no transgressive effect will be observed

IMPLEMENT VARIABLE REGIONS
IMPLEMENT CONSERVED REGIONS
THIS IS NECESSARY

Start writing!
