\begin_layout Abstract
Transcription factors are proteins which recognize and bind to short DNA
 sequences, and they can play an important role in regulating DNA transcription
 in a gene regulatory network.
 Comparing transcription factor binding sites from different related species
 can show functional differences, however even functionally conserved binding
 sites have been shown to vary significantly.
 Zheng et al.
 characterized transcription factor binding variations by using a normalized
 difference score to find 'variable binding regions' across different experiment
s.
 We use statistical comparison of normalized difference score to find conserved
 binding sites and we also use the alignment from different genomes in order
 to classify binding sites.

\begin_layout Section
Background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Protein-DNA interactions play an important role in gene regulation, and
 chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is a methodology for analyzing these
 interactions.
 Antibodies that bind to transcription factors or histone modifiers are
 used to immunoprecipitate the protein-DNA complexes.
 Using chromatin immunoprecipitation and high throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq)
 or oligonucleotide tiling arrays (ChIP-chip) we can identify transcription
 factor binding sites.
 We search for peaks in the data that correspond to an enrichment of ChIP
 in the sequence, which are called binding sites.
 Comparing ChIP data from multiple experiments is important to identify
 functional differences Here we will look at some background papers in the
 field

\begin_layout Section
Method and approach
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We use ChIP-seq data gathered from two seperate yeast strains (S288c and
 YJM789) and then we used alignment of DNA sequences to classify conserved
 transcription factor binding sites similar to Odom, Dowell et al 2007.
 We used a normalized difference score that was defined by Zheng et al.
 to identify conserved binding sites, and propose modifications to consider
 multiple genomes concurrently.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Normalized difference scores
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The normalized difference (NormDiff) score is a useful statistic for comparing
 ChIP-seq data that uses background subtraction and normalization to obtain
 the ChIP-seq binding signal.
 NormDiff uses a simple random model for ChIP-seq (
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

) and control (
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

) which is defined as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
A & \sim & Poisson(f+g)\\
B & \sim & Poisson(cg)
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where- 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 represents the binding signal
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 represents the background noise
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 is a scaling factor between 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, NormDiff is defined for each genome position 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}$
\end_inset

 as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Z(x_{i})=\frac{A(x_{i})-B(x_{i})/c}{\sigma}
\]

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then the scaling factor 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 is estimated as the median ratio of 
\begin_inset Formula $A/B$
\end_inset

 and the variance 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 is estimated from the maximum variance of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{A+B/c^{2}}$
\end_inset

 in a local window.
 Then, the background score is where 
\begin_inset Formula $Z~Normal(0,1)$
\end_inset

 and deviations from the norm are caused by the strong ChIP-seq binding
 signals.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Problem statement
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Zheng et al use the normalized difference score primarily to find binding
 site variations.
 This approach is useful in finding quantitative binding differences, and
 they use their technique for QTL mapping.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We wanted to perform a more detailed analysis of their approach by evaluating
 the alignment of binding sites transcription factor binding using NormDiff.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We want to classify binding sites using their alignment as being conserved,
 gain/loss, turnover, or even unaligned
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
This can help in analyzing the many (900+) 'variable binding sites' that
 Zheng et al found in their analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

Previous work and application
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We were interested in finding conserved binding sites by looking for evidence
 of binding sites even where binding sites were not called by MACS.
 We used an algorithm that reanalyzes binding sites using the normalized
 difference score.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Experimental approach
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We identified a set of high confidence peaks in ChIP-seq data using MACS
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Then we used a sliding window to examine the maximum average NormDiff peak
 score overlapping the peaks and the syntenic regions of each ChIP-seq experimen
t 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Based on the background distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $Z\sim Normal(0,1)$
\end_inset

 we used the maximum average NormDiff score of our scanning window to calculate
 the probability of observing a peak as 
\begin_inset Formula $P(z\leq Z)$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Conserved binding sites were identified as samples where NormDiff scores
 were highly different from the background distribution.

Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We found 42 new binding sites in HS959 with P<0.05 that were conserved in
 S96 that were not identified by MACS.
 Also 4 of these binding sites were conserved with P<0.01
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We found 76 binding sites in S96 with P<0.05 that were conserved in HS959,
 and 13 of these binding sites were conserved with P<0.01 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To evaluate the significance of these findings, we evaluated peaks in S96
 using normalized difference scores and identified 98% (885/897) of the
 binding sites that MACS identifies at P<0.05 confidence level, and 60% (563/897)
 binding sites at a P<0.01.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In HS959 we identified 85% (729/824) of the same peaks that MACS identifies
 at a 0.05 confidence level and 46% (365/824) peaks at P<0.01

Discussion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We identified conserved binding sites from multiple ChIP-seq by using a
 normalized difference score.
 We identified a number of binding sites that were shared with a high probabilit
y that were not identified by peak finding algorithms.
 Our work could be extended to use more sophisticated statistical models.
 We considered modifying NormDiff scores to use data from multiple experiments
 in order to find conserved binding sites.
 The additive and subtractive NormDiff scores find conserved and differential
 expression.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Modified normdiff score
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We propose using a modified NormDiff score that uses data from multiple
 experiments.
 A NormDiff score that adds data from two experiments, A1,B1,A2, and B2
 can be defined as 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Z_{add}(x_{i})=\frac{(A_{1}-B_{1}/c_{1})+(A_{2}-B_{2}/c_{2})}{\sigma}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then the scaling factors 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1}$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{2}$
\end_inset

 are estimated from data, and the variance is 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=\sqrt{A_{1}+B_{1}/c_{1}^{2}+A_{2}+B_{2}/c{}_{2}^{2}}$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A NormDiff score that subtracts data from two experiments could also be
 defined as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Z_{sub}(x_{i})=\frac{(A_{1}-B_{1}/c_{1})-(A_{2}-B_{2}/c_{2})}{\sigma}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The variance for 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{sub}$
\end_inset

 would be the same as the variance for 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{add}$
\end_inset

.
 It is possible that adding and subtracting NormDiff scores might be able
 to help in identifying conserved and differential binding.
 For example, if the subtractive score is small but the additive score is
 large, then the binding site is likely to be conserved in both experiments.

\begin_layout Subsection
Drawbacks of NormDiff
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our approach tries to find evidence for conserved binding sites by analyzing
 data using normalized difference scores.
 Our approach gives some evidence of peaks with high confidence P-values,
 such as our results of finding new peaks with P<0.01.
 However, these findings have much less confidence than thresholds set by
 MACS (P<1e-5).
 Given that our technique for calculating P-value is similar to MACS, by
 finding large deviations from the background distribution, our results
 are not very strong.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the reasons for having less confidence in P-values is because NormDiff
 uses control data for background subtraction.
 MACS on the other hand uses only ChIP-seq data to calculate P-values, and
 does not subtract control data.
 Instead MACS uses control data for filtering and empirical FDR.
 Because of this, finding high confidence peaks relies on using the FDR
 in MACS, and it is actually possible to use FDR to adjust the P-value from
 MACS to be more leniant.
 Because of the weakness, using NormDiff to re-analyze ChIP-seq data that
 MACS already did not call seems unproductive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Applications of NormDiff
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
NormDiff score does have interesting applications for finding conserved
 and differential binding sites.
 For example, Zheng et al.
 defined what they call a 'transgressive score
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to evaluate whether binding sites from yeast cross strains were inherited
 from their parents.
 The transgressive score analyzes the variance of normdiff scores across
 all children versus the normdiff scores from the parents -- it is defined
 as: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{var(Z)}{Z_{parent1}-Z_{parent2}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They say that if the transgressive score is low, then the binding site is
 inherited from one of the parents, and so in some sense it was conserved.
 However, if the transgressive score is high then the binding site was an
 extreme phenotype not found in either parent.
 Their analysis shows in yeast children that some even lowly expressed peaks
 might be called transgressive because they are not conserved with the parents
 at an expected value.

Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Normalized difference scores have a wide variety of applications for comparing
 ChIP-seq experiments.
 Extending our analysis to classify binding sites according to their alignment
 will improve our ability to analyze functional binding site similarities
 and differences.
