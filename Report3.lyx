\begin_layout Abstract
Transcription factors are proteins which recognize and bind to short DNA
 sequences, and they can play an important role in regulating DNA transcription
 in a gene regulatory network.
 Comparing transcription factor binding sites from different related species
 can show important functional similarities and differences, however transcripti
on factor binding sites have also been shown to vary significantly across
 related species and strains.
 Using chromatin immunoprecipitation and high throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq)
 data we can analyze transcription factor binding sites de novo with high
 precision.
 However, comparing ChIP-seq data from multiple experiments presents many
 logistical challenges -- different ChIP-seq experiments have may have different
 signal/noise ratios, so using control experiments and data normalization
 is important.
 Comparing binding sites from different genomes also presents challenges
 because binding sites can vary significantly due to modifications of DNA
 binding sites, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Previous methods to identify conserved transcription factor binding sites
 analyze different genomes separately, then look for binding sites in conserved
 and aligned locations [1].
 We use a model for comparing transcription factor binding from multiple
 genomes by analyzing a normalized difference score that uses information
 from multiple ChIP-seq experiments.
 We propose that this method can help find conserved binding sites across
 multiple experiments.
 We evaluated several existing techniques for analyzing ChIP-seq data analysis
 and propose our method for comparing of ChIP-seq data.

Background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Chromatin immunoprecipitation is a methodology for analyzing protein-DNA
 interactions.
 Antibodies that bind protein-DNA complexes have been developed to do ChIP
 with transcription factors, histones, and DNA methylation (meDIPSeq).
 Using chromatin immunoprecipitation and high throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq)
 or oligonucleotide arrays for tiling the genome (ChIP-chip) we can identify
 transcription factor binding sites.
 by finding peaks in the data we can analyze transcription factor binding.
 Here we will look at some background papers in the field

Zheng et al.
 â€“ Genetic analysis of transcription factor binding variation in yeast
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Zheng et al.
 analyzed binding sites from many yeast ChIP-experiments using and found
 potential sources of binding site differences
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
They first calculated a normalized difference score for ChIP-seq which does
 background subtraction and normalization to get the 'binding signal'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Then they analyzed the variation of normdiff across all experiments to identify
 cis- and trans- factors contributing to binding site variations
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
They found that cis-factors, which are DNA changes that were identified
 using genetic markers and alignments, were the main source of binding variation
s across genomes

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Quantitatively, 85% of variable binding regions in a genetic marker regression
 laid cis to a genetic marker, and the effect size was greater for cis-factors
 than trans-factors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Note: see methods/approach for how the marker regression is important for
 our goals
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Zheng et al.
 also found trans-factors, defined by genetic markers far away from the
 binding sites, that were associated with binding variations (AMN1, FLO8)
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
One of the main results tools from Zheng et al.
 for finding binding site variation is the normalized difference (NormDiff)
 score

\begin_layout Enumerate
NormDiff uses a simple random

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Section
Method and approach
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our method uses ChIP-seq data from different genomes and it uses the alignment
 of DNA sequences to classify conserved transcription factor binding sites.
 We compared ChIP-seq data from two different yeast strains, S96 and HS959
 (Zheng et al 2010), and .
 We used a normalized difference score to identify additional conserved
 binding sites, and propose modifications to consider multiple genomes concurren
tly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Normalized difference scores
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The normalized difference (NormDiff) score is a useful statistic for comparing
 ChIP-seq data that uses background subtraction and normalization.
 NormDiff uses a simple random model for ChIP-seq (
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

) and control (
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

) is defined as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $A\sim Poisson(f+g)$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $B\sim Poisson(cg)$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where- 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 represents the binding signal
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 represents the background signal
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 is a scaling factor between 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, NormDiff is defined for each genome position 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}$
\end_inset

 as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Z(x_{i})=\frac{A(x_{i})-B(x_{i})/c}{\sigma}
\]

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then the scaling factor 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 is estimated as the median ratio of 
\begin_inset Formula $A/B$
\end_inset

 and the variance 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 is estimated from the maximum variance of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{A+B/c^{2}}$
\end_inset

 in a local window.
 Then, the background score is where 
\begin_inset Formula $Z~Normal(0,1)$
\end_inset

 and deviations from the norm are caused by the strong ChIP-seq binding
 signals.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Problem statement
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Zheng et al use the normalized difference score primarily to find binding
 site variability.
 This approach is useful in finding quantitative differences in binding
 using a QTL analysis.
 We wanted to perform a more detailed analysis of Their approach for applying
 QTL analysis to transcription factor binding using NormDiff was very useful.
 However, they generated over 900 variable binding regions with their parameters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Marker regression is used here to analyze variable binding traits as QTL,
 however, analyzing binding site alignments and binding site conservation
 is considered by Odom, Dowell et al to be functional
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In order to characterize these effects, I have to understand QTL mapping
 (somewhat difficult) and also develop the algorithm for scoring alignment
 of binding sites, and whether these effects in yeast can be characterized
 similar to Odom, Dowell et al.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Identifying conserved binding sites is important for several reasons
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
One is that variable regions are of interest for identifying functional
 differences.
 Zhenge et al.
 identified about 900 variable binding regions using their method, and they
 only confirmed two of the markers using
