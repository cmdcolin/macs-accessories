\begin_layout Abstract
Transcription factors are proteins which recognize and bind to short DNA
 sequences, and they can play an important role in regulating DNA transcription
 in a gene regulatory network.
 Comparing transcription factor binding sites from different related species
 can show functional differences, however even functionally conserved binding
 sites have been shown to vary significantly.
 Zheng et al.
 characterized transcription factor binding variations by using a normalized
 difference score to find 'variable binding regions' across different experiment
s.
 We use statistical comparison of normalized difference score to find conserved
 binding sites and we also use the alignment from different genomes in order
 to classify binding sites.

\begin_layout Section
Background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Protein-DNA interactions play an important role in gene regulation, and
 chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is a methodology for analyzing these
 interactions.
 Antibodies that bind to transcription factors or histone modifiers are
 used to immunoprecipitate the protein-DNA complexes.
 Using chromatin immunoprecipitation and high throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq)
 or oligonucleotide tiling arrays (ChIP-chip) we can identify transcription
 factor binding sites.
 We search for peaks in the data that correspond to an enrichment of ChIP
 in the sequence, which are called binding sites.
 Comparing ChIP data from multiple experiments is important to identify
 functional differences Here we will look at some background papers in the
 field

 potential sources of binding site differences
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate

 background subtraction and normalization to get the 'binding signal'
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
They found that cis-factors, which are DNA changes that were identified
 using genetic markers and alignments, were the main source of binding variation

They used a 'single marker regression' to associate variable binding regions
 with genetic markers and found that 85% of variable binding regions in
 a genetic marker regression laid cis to a genetic marker, and the effect

Note: see methods/approach for how the marker regression is important for
 our goals

 also found trans-factors, defined by genetic markers far away from the

One of the main results tools from Zheng et al.
 is the use of NormDiff
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
NormDiff is used to find 'variable binding regions' by finding regions where
 normdiff scores have a high degree of variability across experiments
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Then, variable binding regions are linked with genetic markers using 'single
 marker regression', a technique used to analyze quantitative trait loci
 (QTL)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The genetic markers indicate SNP and indel, but this method does not explicitely
 address the alignment of binding sites.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Furthermore, they found many variable binding regions, on the order of 900,
 so classifying them using an alignment would be useful
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Can we address these issues systematically to find--

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Section
Method and approach
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We use ChIP-seq data gathered from two seperate yeast strains (S288c and
 YJM789) and then we used alignment of DNA sequences to classify conserved
 transcription factor binding sites similar to Odom, Dowell et al 2007.
 We used a normalized difference score that was defined by Zheng et al.
 to identify conserved binding sites, and propose modifications to consider
 multiple genomes concurrently.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Normalized difference scores
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The normalized difference (NormDiff) score is a useful statistic for comparing
 ChIP-seq data that uses background subtraction and normalization to obtain
 the ChIP-seq binding signal.
 NormDiff uses a simple random model for ChIP-seq (
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

) and control (
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

) which is defined as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
A & \sim & Poisson(f+g)\\
B & \sim & Poisson(cg)
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where- 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 represents the binding signal
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 represents the background noise
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 is a scaling factor between 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, NormDiff is defined for each genome position 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}$
\end_inset

 as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Z(x_{i})=\frac{A(x_{i})-B(x_{i})/c}{\sigma}
\]

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then the scaling factor 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 is estimated as the median ratio of 
\begin_inset Formula $A/B$
\end_inset

 and the variance 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 is estimated from the maximum variance of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{A+B/c^{2}}$
\end_inset

 in a local window.
 Then, the background score is where 
\begin_inset Formula $Z~Normal(0,1)$
\end_inset

 and deviations from the norm are caused by the strong ChIP-seq binding
 signals.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Problem statement
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Zheng et al use the normalized difference score primarily to find binding
 site variations.
 This approach is useful in finding quantitative binding differences, and
 they use their technique for QTL mapping.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We wanted to perform a more detailed analysis of their approach by evaluating
 the alignment of binding sites transcription factor binding using NormDiff.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We want to classify binding sites using their alignment as being conserved,
 gain/loss, turnover, or even unaligned
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
This can help in analyzing the many (900+) 'variable binding sites' that
 Zheng et al found in their analysis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The classification made by Zheng et al is linking variable binding with
 genetic markers

This is a technique from QTL analysis to associate cis-factors or trans-factors

\begin_layout Section
Previous work and application
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We were interested in finding conserved binding sites by looking for evidence
 of binding sites even where binding sites were not called by MACS.
 We used an algorithm that reanalyzes binding sites using the normalized
 difference score.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Experimental approach
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We identified a set of high confidence peaks in ChIP-seq data using MACS
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Then we used a sliding window to examine the maximum average NormDiff peak
 score overlapping the peaks and the syntenic regions of each ChIP-seq experimen
t 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Based on the background distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $Z\sim Normal(0,1)$
\end_inset

 we used the maximum average NormDiff score of our scanning window to calculate
 the probability of observing a peak as 
\begin_inset Formula $P(z\leq Z)$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Conserved binding sites were identified as samples where NormDiff scores
 were highly different from the background distribution.

 The HS959 normdiff score of shared peaks with S96 are higher than the HS959

Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We found 42 new binding sites in HS959 with P<0.05 that were conserved in
 S96 that were not identified by MACS.
 Also 4 of these binding sites were conserved with P<0.01
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We found 76 binding sites in S96 with P<0.05 that were conserved in HS959,
 and 13 of these binding sites were conserved with P<0.01 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To evaluate the significance of these findings, we evaluated peaks in S96
 using normalized difference scores and identified 98% (885/897) of the
 binding sites that MACS identifies at P<0.05 confidence level, and 60% (563/897)
 binding sites at a P<0.01.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In HS959 we identified 85% (729/824) of the same peaks that MACS identifies
 at a 0.05 confidence level and 46% (365/824) peaks at P<0.01
